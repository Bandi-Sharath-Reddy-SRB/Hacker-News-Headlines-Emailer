# Hacker News Headlines Emailer

This project aims to scrape the latest headlines from the Hacker News front page and email them to users. It automates the process of fetching, filtering, and formatting the news data into an email-ready format, simplifying the distribution of daily news updates. The project involves the following steps, with each step highlighting a package used to perform the function:

1. **Fetching Content**: Retrieve the content from the Hacker News front page using the [`requests`](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) package.

2. **Scraping Data**: Extract necessary information, such as titles and links of the headlines, using the [`BeautifulSoup`](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) package.

3. **Constructing Email Content**: Build a structured email body that organizes the headlines in a readable format.

4. **Authenticating for Email Sending**: Use the [`smtplib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html) (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) package for email authentication, ensuring secure email transfer.

5. **Sending the Email**: Complete the process by sending the email with the headlines to specified recipients.
